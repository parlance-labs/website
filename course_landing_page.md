**Do you catch yourself asking any of the following questions while building AI applications?**
1. How do I test applications when the outputs are stochastic and require subjective judgements?
2. If I change the prompt, how do I know I'm not breaking something else?
3. Where should I focus my engineering efforts? Do I need to test everything?
4. What if I have no data or customers, where do I start?
5. What metrics should I track? What tools should I use? Which models are best?
6. Can I automate testing and evaluation? If so, how do I trust it?

**If you aren't sure about the answers to these questions, this course is for you.**

**This is a flipped classroom setting**. All lectures are professionally edited and recorded with an emphasis on live office hours and student interaction.
