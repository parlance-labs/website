We're a group of AI engineers led by [Hamel Husain](https://hamel.dev){target="_blank"} who help companies improve AI products with data-driven approaches. We're an engineer-only firm—no handwaving or slide decks.

## What We're About

- We establish [systematic AI evaluation](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals-faq/){target="_blank"} that's specific to your product & domain (because how else will you know if your AI is doing anything useful?)
- We're data-obsessed and pragmatic. We teach you [processes that have worked](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/field-guide/){target="_blank"} across more than 30 AI implementations.
- We've developed methods to make sure your AI can [produce results](https://testimonial.to/ai-evals-course/all){target="_blank"} you trust.

## We Want You to "Fire Us"

**We don't want you to have a long-term dependency on us.** We're not here to pitch you on new frameworks or expensive infrastructure. We're here to teach you methods to experiment faster and systematically improve your systems, regardless of your domain or use-case.

We don't chase recurring revenue or sell maintenance contracts—we think that creates perverse incentives. Instead, we work alongside your team, transfer knowledge so that when we leave, you have:

- The skills to evaluate your AI systems
- Processes for continuous improvement
- Systems that surface the highest impact issues
- The ability to select the best tools and vendors while minimizing complexity
- Independence from consultants (including us!)
